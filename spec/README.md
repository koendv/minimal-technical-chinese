This directory contains the YAML of the grammar deck.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) specialized in natural language processing.
It seems logical to use LLMs for language learning and linguistic analysis.

My interaction with AIs generally follows this workflow:

- `Do not generate. First discuss` 
- Specify what you want
- `Is my intent clear?`
- `Are additional data needed?`
- `What assumptions are made?`
- `Proceed, generate.`
- `Give me the yaml.`

The YAML file represents a structured, plain-text specification of the task. Uploading the YAML to a new AI session resumes where the previous session left off.

Upload YAML, flashcards, and a datasheet to an AI; have the AI validate the flashcards cover almost all grammatical constructs in the datasheet.
